# Homepage Optimization Summary

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL PLANNING DOCUMENT — DO NOT TREAT AS SOURCE OF TRUTH**
>
> This post-hoc summary predates the 2026-04-18 integrity sweep
> (commit `ca26581`). It contains:
> - **Fabricated social-proof claims**: "500+ Las Vegas Families
>   Helped", "30+ Years Experience", "⭐ 4.9/5 Google Reviews" — none
>   of these figures are verifiable. The components that displayed
>   them have been neutralized.
> - **Stale phone numbers**: references `(702) 222-1964` in multiple
>   places. Current canonical is **`(702) 500-1971`** (see
>   `CLAUDE.md` + `components/footer.tsx`).
> - **Stale analytics references**: cites Universal Analytics
>   (`UA-46249003-1`) which Google shut down in 2023-2024. The site
>   now uses GA4 only.
>
> Agents and developers should consult `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` for
> the current canonical configuration.
